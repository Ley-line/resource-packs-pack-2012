# 2012 INTERFACE 3.4 (22-Aug-2020)

# IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR FIND ANY ISSUES, PLEASE MESSAGE ME AT DISCORD @Shredit#6109

## IMPORTANT:

- When you get poisoned or venomed, your HP icon will reset to vanilla sprites due to a conflict with the "Poison" plugin, to fix this
  simply turn off "Change HP Orb Icon" tab from the plugin.
- If you prefer using the vanilla spell/prayer icons, you can select so in the resource packs plugin settings.
