## Latest version: v4.5 (x-May-2022)

*If you have any questions or find any issues, please message Discord **@Shredit#6109** or **@Leyline#5438***

```diff
! This plugin can be installed automatically by using the in-game resource packs hub. Manually installing this pack however, will also allow you to customise your preferences such as the different prayer styles included in the pack. If you prefer using the vanilla spell/prayer icons, you can select so in the resource packs plugin settings.
```
## How to install manually
1. Install the resource packs plugin for RuneLite found in the [plugin-hub](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Information-about-the-Plugin-Hub), or download it [manually](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs)
2. Extract the .zip file you downloaded to a suitable location ***(do not use %userprofile%/.runelite/resource-packs-repository)***
3. (RuneLite) Configuration > Resource packs > Resource pack path > Set the path to where your resource pack is stored in (without the trailing /) ![!image](https://i.imgur.com/K8iEzgt.png)
```diff
- Do not PUT or EDIT your pack in .runelite/resource-packs-repository OR IT WILL GET DELETED.
```
4. Make sure your interface styles plugin gameframe is set to the DEFAULT skin (it can cause weird issues otherwise). Everything else is fine but will require a restart of the plugin should you activate any of them after you have resource pack set up.
5. After you have the path copy and paste it into where the image below has it in. Make sure there is no \ (Windows) or / (Mac, Linux) at the end of it.
6. Restart the plugin or swap the 'Use resource pack' option to reload the pack
7. Enjoy!
